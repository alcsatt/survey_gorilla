### This is a basic **Sinatra** app for creating and taking surveys. 
#### You can log in and then take or create a survey.

*** 

Our minimum viable product is for a user to be able to create and take surveys. While creating a survey, they should 
be able to add an any amount of questions as well as an any amount of responses to those questions. On submission of 
a survey, we will see some sort of results page.
